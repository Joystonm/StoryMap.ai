# StoryMap.ai – Where AI Turns the Outback into Stories

StoryMap.ai is an AI-powered cultural storyteller that transforms maps into living narratives. Instead of just showing roads and pins, it invites users to explore rural Australia's heart — its history, Indigenous heritage, climate challenges, and culture — through personalized AI-generated stories, visuals, and recommendations.

Whether you're a student, tourist, researcher, or simply curious, StoryMap.ai helps you understand and appreciate the people, traditions, and struggles that make regional Australia unique.

## 🌟 Core Idea

Turn location data into emotional, interactive stories. By blending Groq-powered AI narratives, Qloo cultural insights, and Tavily's local knowledge with an interactive Leaflet map, StoryMap.ai lets users explore towns, farms, and remote regions as if guided by a local storyteller.

## ✨ Feature Highlights

### 🎨 Outback Culture Explorer

- **Cultural Recommendations**: Qloo provides music, art, and film suggestions from each region
- **Interactive Media**: Users can listen to songs and view artwork, turning learning into an immersive experience
- **Map Overlays**: Leaflet highlights museums, indigenous landmarks, and local events

### 📖 AI Rural Storyteller
- **Mini Documentaries**: Select a town/farm/mining area → get multi-paragraph AI-curated narratives blending history, industry, and human stories
- **AI-Generated Art**: Visual interpretations of a region's past, present, or imagined future
- **Shareable Stories**: One-click share to social media — perfect for tourism campaigns or educators

### 🌡️ Climate Memory Map
- **Past vs Future**: Interactive before/after visualizations for bushfire-hit, flood-prone, or drought-affected areas
- **AI Tips**: Groq suggests preparation measures and local support resources
- **Community Input**: Crowdsource stories and experiences to enrich the map's emotional depth

### 🪃 Indigenous Knowledge Preserver
- **Language Revival**: Learn words and phrases from endangered First Nations languages
- **Dreamtime Stories**: AI curates and retells indigenous myths tied to the land
- **Art & Music**: Qloo recommends indigenous creators and music playlists
- **Interactive Quizzes**: Gamified cultural learning experiences

## 🚀 How It Works

   - Groq → Generates stories, tips, and contextual insights
4. **Frontend Displays Result**:
   - Map zooms to selected area
   - Left panel shows narrative, music, art suggestions
   - Right panel shows climate visualization (if relevant)
   - Optional "Generate Art" button for AI-generated images
5. **User Interacts & Shares** → Save, share, or explore nearby towns

## 🎨 UI/UX Vision

- **Landing Page**: Hero section with tagline "Explore the untold stories of rural Australia"
- **Map-First Layout**: Interactive map with scrollable narrative panel
- **Mood**: Soft, earthy tones giving an authentic Outback vibe
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions when zooming or loading stories
